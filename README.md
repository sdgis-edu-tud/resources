## GIS

### Basemaps
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/52.154/5.295) - OpenStreetMap is the free wiki world map. This colloborative project is one of the largest databases of volunteered geographic information in the world. Its contents include points of interest, routable networks, and other geodata.
- [BBBike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/) - Provides shapefiles and raw OSM format for cities around the world, extracted weekly. This is useful if you are looking for data extracts for a single city.
- [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/) - OpenStreetMap extracts prepared in either PBF or shapefile format for download daily.
- [MetroExtracts](https://www.interline.io/osm/extracts/) - Each day, OSM Extracts by Interline mirrors the entire OpenStreetMap planet and creates city and region sized extracts ready for download into formats ready for GIS.
- [OverpassTurbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) -  Overpass Turbo is a web-based data mining tool for OpenStreetMap. It runs any kind of Overpass API query, shows the results on an interactive map, and allows users to export query data in the form of GeoJSON files (which may be converted to Shapefiles). It also provides helpful support for new users in the form of the "Wizard" tool. Using Overpass Turbo, you can query virtually any location globally using dedicated tags in Open Street Map.
- [ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/) - ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World is the foremost collection of geographic information from around the globe. It includes maps, apps, and data layers to support your work.
- [AHN-Viewer](https://ahn.arcgisonline.nl/ahnviewer/) - Height map of the Netherlands
